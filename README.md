# NAME
krenewd - Kerberos ticket refresh daemon

# SYNOPSIS
krenewd [OPTION]...

# DESCRIPTION
**krenewd** is a daemon designed to automatically renew Kerberos tickets. It monitors a session or process ID and renews Kerberos tickets at defined intervals while the process or session is alive. It can utilize a keytab file to acquire a ticket if no ticket is available at startup.

# OPTIONS
Most options can also be configured via environment variables. This can be useful for debugging or when defining global configuration defaults. The environment variables use the same values as the command-line options. However, command-line options take precedence over environment variables. Flags can be unset via `--option-name=false` (only the long form is supported in this case).  

**-h, --help**  
Display the help text and exit.

**-V, --version**  
Show version and copyright information, then exit.

**-s, --session-id=\<string\>** (*XDG_SESSION_ID*)  
Specify the login session ID to monitor, defaulting to the current session as determined by `XDG_SESSION_ID`.

**-m, --master=\<pid\>** (*KRENEWD_MASTER*)  
Set the process ID to monitor. Specify '0' to disable monitoring. If neither process nor session IDs are provided, the parent process is monitored by default. Overrides **session-id**.

**-i, --interval=\<seconds\>** (*KRENEWD_INTERVAL*)  
Define the time interval between ticket renewals, in seconds. Default is 200 seconds.

**-d, --destroy** (*KRENEWD_DESTROY*)  
Destroy the ticket on exit, but only if the lock was acquired during the session or if **no-lock** was specified.

**-p, --no-passive** (*KRENEWD_NOPASSIVE*)  
Exit immediately if the lock cannot be acquired, instead of waiting.

**-f, --foreground** (*KRENEWD_FOREGROUND*)  
Run the daemon in the foreground, preventing it from forking into the background.

**-v, --verbose** (*KRENEWD_VERBOSE*)  
Enable verbose output to provide more insights into what `krenewd` is doing.

**-t, --trace** (*KRENEWD_TRACE*)  
Enable trace output from `kinit`, useful for debugging Kerberos authentication issues.

**-l, --no-lock** (*KRENEWD_NOLOCK*)  
Allow multiple instances of the daemon to run simultaneously by ignoring the singleton lock.

**-b, --no-block** (*KRENEWD_NOBLOCK*)  
Proceed without waiting if the initial ticket acquisition/refresh fails.  
By default, `krenewd` blocks in the foreground until it has acquired/refreshed the ticket for the given principal. If **no-block** is specified, it will *try only once* and then fork into the background. This is important for login shells to avoid blocking the user but still provide a ticket under normal circumstances for following processes. This is crucial when the ticket is used immediately after starting `krenewd` â€” for example, when the home folder is on a Kerberized NFS share.

**-k, --keytab=\<existing path\>** (*KRENEWD_KEYTAB*)  
Specify a custom path for the keytab file. If not provided, the keytab file will be auto-detected based on the following search order:  
  1. `/etc/$USER.keytab`  
  2. `$HOME/.krenewd/krb5.keytab`  
  3. `$HOME/$USER.keytab`  
  4. `$HOME/krb5.keytab`  
  5. `$HOME/.krb5.keytab`  
  6. `/etc/krb5.keytab`

**-J, --journal** (*KRENEWD_JOURNAL*)  
When specified, `krenewd` will send all log messages to the systemd journal *in addition to logging to stderr*.  
`krenewd` uses structured logging. The following fields will be added to each message:  
  - **PID** (krenewd's own process ID)  
  - **PPID** (The ID of the parent process that started krenewd)  
  - **SESSION** (The systemd session ID)  
  - **MASTER_PID** (The ID of the process that `krenewd` is monitoring)  
  - **PRINCIPAL** (The principal of the ticket that `krenewd` will try to acquire/refresh)  
  - **USER** (The Linux user account name under which `krenewd` is running)

  *Note: Some fields may be empty during early process startup.*

# ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
Refer to the command-line options above for details.  
Boolean variables can take the following values: `true`/`false`, `yes`/`no`, `enabled`/`disabled`, `1`/`0`.  
  - **XDG_SESSION_ID** (string)  
  - **KRENEWD_INTERVAL** (integer)  
  - **KRENEWD_DESTROY** (boolean)  
  - **KRENEWD_NOPASSIVE** (boolean)  
  - **KRENEWD_FOREGROUND** (boolean)  
  - **KRENEWD_VERBOSE** (boolean)  
  - **KRENEWD_TRACE** (boolean)  
  - **KRENEWD_NOLOCK** (boolean)  
  - **KRENEWD_NOBLOCK** (boolean)  
  - **KRENEWD_KEYTAB** (filename)  
  - **KRENEWD_JOURNAL** (boolean)

# EXAMPLES
- **Shell profile/bashrc**  
	To run the daemon from your profile or bashrc, include the `--no-block` and `--journal` options:  
		`krenewd --no-block --verbose --journal >/dev/null 2>\&1 </dev/null`  
	View log messages via:  
		`journalctl --user _COMM=krenewd`

- **Daemon accounts**  
	To enable the service for a specific daemon user:  
		`systemctl enable --now krenewd@USERNAME.service`  
	Replace `USERNAME` with the daemon user name.  
	Make sure to place a keytab at one of the search locations given in the **keytab** option.
	The daemon user will then always have a valid ticket available.  
	If writing a dependant service, ensure it starts after the `krenewd` service by including:  
		`After=krenewd@USERNAME.service`  
		`Requires=krenewd@USERNAME.service`

- **PAM integration**  
	To enable `krenewd` automatically via PAM on login, add the following to `/etc/pam.d/common-session`:  
		`session optional pam_exec.so seteuid type=open_session /usr/bin/krenewd.pam --no-block --verbose --journal`
